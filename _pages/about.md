My name is Xinran Xiong. I am currently studying computer science at McGill University. Now, my great passion is becoming a developer that can bring incredible applications to human life. Therefore, I always try to take most relevant courses to get prepared.

Currently, my interest focuses on full stack development on different platforms. If you are looking for a student as a web/ software developer, please do not hesitate to contact me. I love to be challenged to learn new languages and development techniques that can benefit your company.
